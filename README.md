# Flappy Bird Game

Welcome to the Flappy Bird Game project! This project is designed to help beginners learn Flutter by contributing to an open-source game. The game is a simple clone of the classic Flappy Bird, where the player controls a bird to navigate through barriers without hitting them.

## Demo
[Watch Demo Video](./flappy_bird.mp4)

## Project Overview
This project is built using Flutter, a popular framework for building cross-platform applications. The game logic, UI, and animations are implemented in Dart. Participants will complete the game by implementing missing functions and logic.

## Tasks for Participants
Below are the tasks that need to be completed to make the game functional:

1. **Implement the Game Loop**
   - File: `lib/homepage.dart`
   - Function: `startGame`
   - **Hint:** Use a `Timer` to periodically update the bird's position and barriers. Apply physics equations to simulate gravity and jumping.

2. **Reset the Game**
   - File: `lib/homepage.dart`
   - Function: `resetGame`
   - **Hint:** Reset all game variables to their initial values.

3. **Show Game Over Dialog**
   - File: `lib/homepage.dart`
   - Function: `_showDialog`
   - **Hint:** Use the `showDialog` function to display a dialog when the game ends. Include a restart option.

4. **Implement Jump Logic**
   - File: `lib/homepage.dart`
   - Function: `jump`
   - **Hint:** Reset the time and update the bird's initial position to simulate a jump.

5. **Check if the Bird is Dead**
   - File: `lib/homepage.dart`
   - Function: `birdisDead`
   - **Hint:** Return `true` if the bird goes out of bounds.
